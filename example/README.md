# Example App for React Native Paper

## React Native App

You can run the React Native app with [this Snack](https://snack.expo.dev/@react-native-paper/react-native-paper-example_v5). Snack allows you to make changes to the example app directly in the online editor and see changes on your phone instantly using the [Expo](https://expo.dev/) app without having to install or setup anything on your computer. You can also "Export" it to download as a standalone Expo app to run locally.

If you want to run the example from the repo,

- Clone the repository and run `yarn` in the root
- Run `yarn example start` to start the packager
- Follow the instructions to open it with the [Expo app](https://expo.dev/)

## Web App

You can also run the example app as a web app using [react-native-web](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web),

- Clone the repository and run `yarn` in the root
- Run `yarn example web` to start the webpack server and open the app in your browser
